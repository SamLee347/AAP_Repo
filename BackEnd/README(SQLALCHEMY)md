sqlalchemy library used for database management (needed for chatbot access to data)
### DO 
-pip install sqlalchemy (sqlalchemy library)
-pip install mysql-connector-python (extension for mysql handling)

### setup
musername=aap, password=mysql, schema=aap 

### make sure to create a schema locally if app.py doesnt run due to mysql

### Database - configure the database and initialize in app.py
### Models folder - define the entities and rows
(i made everything into a decoupled format with each entity having one file and all loaded into __init__.py which is called when importing pack)


### About __init__.py if curious:
__init__.py is a special Python file that makes a folder a package, basically allows other files to use the classes and functions from the folder, 
like javascript export module.



maybe your sql was not created properly works for me(Kendrick)
